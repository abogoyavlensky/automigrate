## Development

### Run locally

```bash
make up  # run docker-compose with databases for development
make repl  # run builtin repl with dev aliases; also you could use any repl you want
make test  # run whole tests locally against testing database started by docker-compose
make fmt  # run formatting in action mode
make lint  # run linting
make check-deps  # run checking new versions of deps in force mode
```

### Release new version

```bash
make install-snapshot :patch  # build and install locally a new version of lib based on latest git tag and using semver
make release :patch  # bump git tag version by semver rules and push to remote repo
```

In CI there is the github action which publish any new git tag as new version of the lib to Clojars.
