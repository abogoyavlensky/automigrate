# automigrate

[![CI](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/automigrate/actions/workflows/checks.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/automigrate/actions/workflows/checks.yaml)

Database auto-migration tool for Clojure. Define models as plain edn data structures, 
and create database schema migrations based on changes of the models automatically.

## Features

- define db schema as **models** in edn **declaratively**;
- **automatically** update db schema **migrations** based on models' changes;
- create and update tables, columns and indexes without touching SQL;
- ability to add raw SQL migration for specific cases;
- view raw SQL for any migration;
- migrate to any migration in forward and backward *[:construction: under development]* directions.

make fmt  # run formatting in action mode
make lint  # run linting
