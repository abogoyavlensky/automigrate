# Automigrate

[![CI](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/automigrate/actions/workflows/checks.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/automigrate/actions/workflows/checks.yaml)

Database auto-migration tool for Clojure. Define models as plain edn data structures, 
and create database schema migrations based on changes of the models automatically.


## Features

- define db schema as **models** in edn **declaratively**;
- **automatically migrate** db schema based on models' changes;
- view raw SQL for any migration;
- ability to add raw SQL migration for specific cases or data migrations;
- migrate to any migration in forward and backward *[:construction: under development]* directions;
- support for PostgreSQL *[:construction: others are under development]*;

## State

Project is in **alpha** state till the `1.0.0` version, and it is not ready for production use for now. 
Breaking changes are possible.


## Usage

### Installation

**TODO:** add release label from Clojars! 

A config for development environment could look like following example.

#### tools.deps -X option

*deps.edn*
```clojure
{...
 :aliases {...
           :migrations {:extra-deps {net.clojars.abogoyavlensky/automigrate {:mvn/version "<LATEST VERSION>"}
                                     org.postgresql/postgresql {:mvn/version "42.3.1"}}
                        :ns-default automigrate.core
                        :exec-args {:models-file "src/resources/db/models.edn"
                                    :migrations-dir "src/resources/db/migrations"
                                    :jdbc-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb?user=myuser&password=secret"}}}}
```

:information_source: *Or you can move postgres driver to project's `:deps` section.* 

Then you could use it as:

```shell
clojure -X:migrations make
```

#### tools.deps -T option

Alternatively you can use following alias with `-T` option (*from clojure tools cli version >= `1.10.3.933`*).
The difference is that project's deps is not included for running migrations.  

*deps.edn*
```clojure
{...
 :aliases {...
           :migrations {:deps {net.clojars.abogoyavlensky/automigrate {:mvn/version "<LATEST VERSION>"}
                               org.postgresql/postgresql {:mvn/version "42.3.1"}}
                        :ns-default automigrate.core
                        :exec-args {:models-file "src/resources/db/models.edn"
                                    :migrations-dir "src/resources/db/migrations"
                                    :jdbc-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb?user=myuser&password=secret"}}}}
```

Then you could use it as:

```shell
clojure -T:migrations make
```

#### Leiningen

:construction: *Leiningen support is under development.*

### Getting started

After configuration, you could create models.edn file with first model, 
make migration for it and migrate db schema. Choose paths for migrations and models as you want.
Let's do it step by step.

#### Add model

*resources/db/models.edn*
```clojure
{:book [[:id :serial {:unique true
                      :primary-key true}]
        [:name [:varchar 256] {:null false}]
        [:description :text]]}
```

#### Make migration
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations make
Created migration: resources/db/migrations/0001_auto_create_table_book.edn
Actions:
  - create table book
```

And the migration at `resources/db/migrations/0001_auto_create_table_book.edn` will look like:
```clojure
({:action :create-table,
  :model-name :book,
  :fields
  {:id {:unique true, :primary-key true, :type :serial},
   :name {:null false, :type [:varchar 256]},
   :description {:type :text}}})

```

#### Migrate
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate
Migrating: 0001_auto_create_table_book...
Successfully migrated: 0001_auto_create_table_book
```

That's it, in db you could see newly created table called `book` with defined columns 
and one entry in model `automigrated_migrations` with new migration `0001_auto_create_table_book`.

#### List and explain migrations

To view status of existing migrations you could run:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations list
[âœ“] 0001_auto_create_table_book.edn
```

To view raw SQL for existing migration you could run command `explain` with appropriate number: 
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations explain :number 1
SQL for migration 0001_auto_create_table_book.edn:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE book (id SERIAL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL, description TEXT);
COMMIT;
```

:information_source: *For a little more complex example please check [models.edn](/examples/models.edn)
and [README.md](/examples/README.md) from `examples` dir of this repo.* 

## Documentation

### Model definition

Models represented as a map with model name as a keyword key and value described the model itself. 
Model's definition could be a vector of vectors in simple case to define just fields.
As we saw in previous example:

```clojure
{:book [[:id :serial {:unique true
                      :primary-key true}]
        [:name [:varchar 256] {:null false}]
        [:description :text]]}
```

Or it could be a map with two keys `:fields` and (*optional*) `:indexes`. Each one is a vector of vectors too. 
Same model could be described as a map:
```clojure
{:book {:fields [[:id :serial {:unique true
                               :primary-key true}]
                [:name [:varchar 256] {:null false}]
                [:description :text]]}}
```

#### Fields

Each field is a vector of three elements: `[:field-name :field-type {:some-option :option-value}]`. 
Third element is optional, but name and type are required.

First element is a name of a field and must be a keyword.

##### Field types
Second element could be a keyword or a vector of keyword and integer. 
Available field types are presented in following table:

| Field type             | Description                                                         |

| `:time`                |                                                                     |
| `:point`               |                                                                     |
| `:json`                |                                                                     |
| `:jsonb`               |                                                                     |
| `[:varchar <pos-int>]` | second element is the length of value                               |

#### Indexes

Each index is a vector of three elements: `[:name-of-index :type-of-index {:fields [:field-from-model-to-index] :unique boolean?}]`
Name, type and `:fields` in options are required.

First element is a name of an index and must be a keyword.

#### make

Create migration for new changes in models' file.
It detects creating, updating and deleting of tables, columns and indexes.
Each migration is wrapped by transaction by default.

*Specific args:*

| Argument          | Description                                              | Required?                                            | Possible values                               | Default value                                           |

##### Examples

Create migration automatically with auto-generated name:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations :make
Created migration: resources/db/migrations/0001_auto_create_table_book.edn
Actions:
  ...
```

Create migration automatically with custom name:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations make :name create_table_author
Created migration: resources/db/migrations/0002_create_table_author.edn
Actions:
  ...
```

Create empty sql migration with custom name:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations make :type :empty-sql :name add_custom_trigger
Created migration: resources/db/migrations/0003_add_custom_trigger.sql
```

Try to create migration without new changes in models:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations make
There are no changes in models.
```


#### migrate

Apply changes described in migration to database.
Tries to apply all unapplied migrations by number order if arg `:number` is not presented in command.
Throws error for same migration number.

:warning: *Backward migration is not fully implemented yet for auto-migrations, but already works for custom SQL migrations.
For auto-migrations it is possible to unapply migration, and delete appropriate entry from migrations table.
But database changes will not be unapplied for now.*

*Specific args:*

| Argument  | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Required? | Possible values                                 | Default value                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:number` | Number of migration which should be a target point. In forward direction migration by number will by applied. In backward direction migration by number will not be applied. | `false`   | integer (example: `1` for migration `0001_...`) | *not provided*, last migration number by default |

##### Examples

Migrate forward all unapplied migrations:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate
Migrating: 0001_auto_create_table_book...
Successfully migrated: 0001_auto_create_table_book
Migrating: 0002_create_table_author...
Successfully migrated: 0002_create_table_author
Migrating: 0003_add_custom_trigger...
Successfully migrated: 0003_add_custom_trigger
```

Migrate forward up to particular migration number (*included*):
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate :number 2
Migrating: 0001_auto_create_table_book...
Successfully migrated: 0001_auto_create_table_book
Migrating: 0002_create_table_author...
Successfully migrated: 0002_create_table_author
```

Migrate backward up to particular migration number (*excluded*):
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate :number 1
Unapplying: 0002_create_table_author...
WARNING: backward migration isn't fully implemented yet. Database schema has not been changed!

Print out actual raw SQL for particular migration by number.

*Specific args:*

| Argument      | Description                                      | Required?    | Possible values                                 | Default value  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `:number`     | Number of migration which should be explained.   | `true`       | integer (example: `1` for migration `0001_...`) | *not provided* |
| `:direction`  | Direction in which migration should be explained | `false`      | `:forward`, `:backward`                         | `:forward`     |

##### Examples:

View raw SQL for migration in forward direction:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations explain :number 1
SQL for migration 0001_auto_create_table_book.edn:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE book (id SERIAL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL, description TEXT);
COMMIT;
```

View raw SQL for migration in backward direction:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations explain :number 1 :direction :backward
SQL for migration 0001_auto_create_table_book.edn:

WARNING: backward migration isn't fully implemented yet.
```

#### help/doc

You can print docstring for function in default the namespace of the lib by running clojure cli `help/doc` function.

Print doc for all available functions:

```shell
$ clojure -X:deps:migrations help/doc :ns automigrate.core
Public interface for lib's users.

-------------------------
...
```

Print doc for particular function:

```shell
$ clojure -X:deps:migrations help/doc :ns automigrate.core :fn make
-------------------------
automigrate.core/make
...
```


### Custom SQL migration 

There are some specific cases which is not supported by auto-migrations for a while. 
Or there are cases when you need to add simple data migration.
You can add a custom SQL migration which contains a raw SQL for forward and backward direction separately in single sql-file.
For that you could run command for making empty sql migration with custom name:

```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations make :type :empty-sql :name make_all_accounts_active
Created migration: resources/db/migrations/0003_make_all_accounts_active.sql
```

Newly created file will look like:
```sql
-- FORWARD


-- BACKWARD

```

You could fill it with two block of queries for forward and backward migration. For example:
```sql
-- FORWARD

UPDATE account
SET is_active = true;

-- BACKWARD

UPDATE account
SET is_active = false;

```

Then migrate it as usual:
```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate
Migrating: 0003_make_all_accounts_active...
Successfully migrated: 0003_make_all_accounts_active
```


### Use in production

:warning: *For now the lib is not ready for production use. 
But it is really appreciated if you try it for you personal projects! :wink:*

For now, there is just single way to configure db connection url as a `:jdbc-url` arg for a command.
The idea here is that you could override default dev `:jdbc-url` value from `deps.edn` by running `migrate`
command with env var inlined, using bash-script, makefile or whatever you want:

```shell
$ clojure -X:migrations migrate :jdbc-url $DATABASE_URL 
Migrating: ...
```

*The downside of that approach could be a lack of ability to use a common config for a project.
In the future there could be more convenient options for configuration if it will be needed.*

## Roadmap draft

- [ ] Support backward auto-migration.
- [ ] Support custom migration using Clojure.
- [ ] Support running with Leiningen.
- [ ] Support array, enum and other fields in PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Support comment for field.
- [ ] Support autogenerated custom constraints and checks.
- [ ] Support for migrating views.
- [ ] Support for SQLite and MySQL.
- [ ] Optimize autogenerated sql queries.
- [ ] Test against different versions of db and Clojure.
- [ ] Add visual representation of db schema by models. 
- [ ] Handle of model/field renaming.


### Things still in design

- Should args `:models-file` and `:migrations-dir` are set by default?
- Should it be possible to set arg `:jdbc-url` as an env var?
- How to handle common configuration conveniently?
- More consistent and proper way for printing messages for users.


## Development

### Run locally

```shell
make up  # run docker-compose with databases for development
make repl  # run builtin repl with dev aliases; also you could use any repl you want
make test  # run whole tests locally against testing database started by docker-compose
make fmt  # run formatting in action mode
make lint  # run linting
make check-deps  # run checking new versions of deps in force mode
```

### Release new version

```shell
make install-snapshot :patch  # build and install locally a new version of lib based on latest git tag and using semver
make release :patch  # bump git tag version by semver rules and push to remote repo
```

*In CI there is the [GitHub action](/.github/workflows/release.yaml) 
which publish any new git tag as new version of the lib to Clojars.*
